## Hello again! 

Jan 13th '26

Being that this is my first update, it might be slightly longer than others as I've been working through TryHackMe's CyberSecurity Learning Roadmap.

Here are a couple of bullet points of areas I've covered:

- Networking fundamentals

  Everything from "what is a network" to how the internet works. This was a crash course in everything "networks" and left me with a good foundational knowledge of some basic concepts, like IPv4 vs IPv6 and why a move away from IPv4 is inevitable, then into slightly more complex concepts, like the TCP 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN ACK, ACK), the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model and Firewalls.
  
This was a pretty big data-dump of a module but I can see why these are fundamentals of any CyberSecurity role. Understanding that vulnerabilities to a device, for at-home use or up to a global corporation's network, really only exist once a device joins a network is surely a cornerstone of everything else going forward.

- How the Web Works
  
  Understanding the importance of Domain Names for a user to be able to interact with the internet intuitively, HTTP & HTTPS and URLs (instructions on how to access a resource on the net).

This module put some facts behind the everyday task of logging onto the net and browsing - understanding the step-by-step process that takes place when you sit at home and type "GitHub.com" into your browser (request site in browser, local cache, recursive DNS server etc)

- Linux & Windows fundamentals

  I feel like this pretty much does what it says on the tin. Some introductions into the terminal in Linux (using Ubuntu) and a bit more of a deep-dive with Windows into Active Directory, Group Policies and Organisational Units (OUs).
  

I'm just about to start delving more into the Windows command line and look forward to getting into some more concepts.
